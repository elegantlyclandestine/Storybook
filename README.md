 Sometime in September, I had the idea to create my most ambitious project to date: *an alternate reality game (ARG) named [Enigma](https://github.com/IOServerSoftware/halloween-enigma)*. The concept was that I would go missing, but Enigma (yes, that was *literally* his name) has me trapped in their place and he's making you play a game to try to get me back to safety.
 
 While buggy at first when I tried deploying it to a Linux VPS provided by [Dantdmnl](https://github.com/Dantdmnl) (dank je wel!), I'd say the engagement would speak for itself - it worked really well. It was an idea I had that would hopefully boost server engagement with members. *It did, to an extent.*

 And then after compiling Enigma for maybe the 28th time to fix the last set of bugs, I had an idea. *Why not make it easier to make ARGs like Enigma?*
